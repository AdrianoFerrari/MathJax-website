# MathJax-website

This repository is work in progress and will be the home for the new
www.mathjax.org.

We are currently migrating from the existing Wordpress-driven site.

## Notes for developers

* The site is build with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [GitHub
Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
* For GitHub pages, the gh-pages branch is the main branch; work off that one.
* Logos etc. must be hosted on the CDN for IP reasons.
