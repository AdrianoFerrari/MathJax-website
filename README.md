# MathJax-website

This repository hosts the source for www.mathjax.org.

We have migrated from an older Wordpress-driven site. Some lose ends still need to be tied up so feel free to lend us a hand by filing issues or making pull requests.

## Notes for developers

* The site is build with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [GitHub
Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
* For GitHub pages, the `gh-pages` branch is the main branch so please branch off `gh-pages`.
* Logos etc. must be hosted on the CDN for IP reasons.
