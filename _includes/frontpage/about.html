      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>The MathJax Consortium is a joint venture of the <a href="http://www.ams.org">American Mathematical Society</a> (AMS) and the <a href="http://www.siam.org">Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics</a> (SIAM) to advance mathematical and scientific content on the web.</p>
        <h3>Core Goals</h3>
        <p>The core of the MathJax project is the development of its state-of-the-art, open source, JavaScript platform for display of mathematics. Our key design goals are</p>
        <ul>
          <li>high-quality display of mathematics notation in all browsers</li>
          <li>no special browser setup required</li>
          <li>support for LaTeX, MathML and other equation markup directly in the HTML source.</li>
          <li>an extensible, modular design with a rich API for easy integration into web applications.</li>
          <li>support for accessibility, copy and paste and other rich functionality</li>
          <li>interoperability with other applications and math-aware search.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advisory Committees</h3>
        <p>
          The MathJax Steering Committee and the MathJax Technical Committee meet regularly to advise the MathJax team on its development goals and priorities. We’re grateful for the support of our committee members!</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          MathJax grew out of the popular <a href="http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/">jsMath</a> project, an earlier Ajax-based math rendering system developed by Davide Cervone in 2004. In the following years, there were many significant developments relevant for web publication of mathematics: consolidation of browser support for CSS 2.1, Web Font technology, adoption of math accessibility standards, and increasing usage of XML workflows for scientific publication.</p>
        <p>In 2009, AMS, Design Science, and SIAM formed the MathJax Consortium to enable Cervone and others to design MathJax from the ground up as a next-generation platform, while still benefiting from the extensive real-world experience gained from jsMath. Since its initial release in 2010, MathJax has become the gold standard for mathematics on the web.</p>
        <h3>The MathJax Team</h3>
        <p>The MathJax team is <a href="https://github.com/dpvc">Davide Cervone</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zorkow">Volker Sorge</a> with support by the staff at AMS and SIAM. Regular contributors include <a href="https://github.com/christianp">Christian Lawson-Perfect</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pkra">Peter Krautzberger</a>.</p>
