MathJax is pleased to announce that [WebAssign](http://www.webassign.net) has renewed its sponsorship of the MathJax project as a [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/#supporters).

WebAssign is a leading provider of online instructional tools for faculty and students. WebAssign offers customizable precoded questions from a wide range of math and science textbooks along with easy-to-use tools that allow instructors to create their own questions. The integration of MathJax in both content and editing allows WebAssign to provide native and accessible mathematical content for its users.

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with WebAssign and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
