“Thanks to dedicated sponsors like OUP, we are able to maintain and enhance MathJax as the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. The productive feedback we receive from the team at OUP is invaluable in achieving our mission to make mathematics a first class citizen on the web.”
