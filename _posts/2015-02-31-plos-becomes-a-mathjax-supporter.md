[PLOS](http://www.plos.org) (Public Library of Science) is boosting MathJax by joining our sponsorship program as [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

PLOS is a non-profit, open-access publisher and advocacy organization founded to accelerate progress in science and medicine. Since 2003, PLOS has launched 7 journals as well as innovative publications like PLOS ONE, PLOS Collections, and PLOS Currents. PLOS works to overcome unnecessary barriers to immediate availability of research, to optimize the quality and integrity of the publication process, and to develop innovative approaches to the assessment, organization and reuse of ideas and data.

“Becoming a MathJax Supporter is a great example for PLOS's commitment to providing the science community with reliable, flexible, and open technology", comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "It allows PLOS to make optimal use of MathJax and helps ensure the continuous development of MathJax.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with PLOS, and welcomes their support for the MathJax project.
